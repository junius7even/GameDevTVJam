So, guys, these two scripts have not been made from scratch by me. In fact, theses scripts ( PlayerMovement and PlayerInput ) come straight
from a tutorial that Unity has made in 2018, about how to make a 2D platformer game. I think we can reuse some logic, instead of
making brand new ones, but also, those scripts can be served as guidelines on how to achieve what we're aiming for. So, feel free, to check
these out, and make your own assessment. The codes in there are well commented.
